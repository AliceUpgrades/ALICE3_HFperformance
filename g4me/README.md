## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to collect the macros and utilities to study the performances of the ALICE3 detector with heavy-flavoured hadrons, including charmed and beauty hadrons, HF jets and quarkonia. For these studies, the ALICE3 detector setup is simulated using the [DelphesO2](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/DelphesO2) package, while the heavy-flavour reconstruction is performed using the [O<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2) analysis framework.
